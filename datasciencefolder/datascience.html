				<dt class="col-sm-3">History of the word 'data science'</dt>
				<dd class= "col-sm-9">Originally, in the 1960s, the term 'data science' was used in place of 'computer science.' A distinction between 'computer science' and 'data science' was first clearly noted in C.F Jeff Wu's inaugaral lecture, which was called "Statistics = Data Science?". Data science was introduced as an independent discipline in 2001 by William Cleveland. In 2012 Harvard Business Review had an article called "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century." As you can see, much progress has been made when it comes to the definition of "data scientist".</dd>
