					<p class="text-justify">Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a very broad term for what is arguably one of the fastest growing areas of computer science. The initial ideas and concepts of AI were first conceived in the mid 1900's which may seem crazy, as to many people it has only recently become a thing. The pioneers of AI where thinking theoretically rather than practically because back then, with the computational power they had available to them, it would have been near impossible to try and implement it practically.</p>
