		<p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a very broad term for what is arguably one of the fastest growing areas of computer science. The inital ideas and concepts of AI where first concepted in the mid 1900's which may seem crazy as to many people it has only just become a thing. This is because the pioneers of AI where thinking theoretically because back then with the computational power they had, it would have been near impossible and very impractical to try and implement it practically.</p>
